      <h2>🎨 Drawing: Lines That Breathe</h2>
      <p>Drawing has always been something I simply enjoy — not to express deep emotions, but just because I love it. Since childhood, I’ve drawn the same little scenery over and over: a house, a coconut tree beside it, mountains in the back, a sunset, and birds flying across the sky. Whether I’m bored in class or just sitting alone, I end up sketching it. My bench has that scene carved into it, and so do the last pages of all my notebooks. It’s a simple habit, but one that’s stayed with me through everything.</p>

      <h2>🌕 The Silent Moon Speaks</h2>
      <p>The moon has always held a special place in my heart. Since childhood, it’s captured my attention with its gentle glow and quiet presence. I remember staring at it through the train window on trips to my hometown, wondering how it seemed to follow us wherever we went. That curiosity slowly turned into love — a quiet admiration for this beautiful creation of nature. Even now, I find myself looking up, always searching for the moon in the sky. There’s something magical about it… like it’s silently watching over us, whispering secrets only a few can hear.</p>

    <div class="blog-card" id="cats">
        <h2>🐱 Whiskers & Worries: My Love-Fear Tale of Cats</h2>
        <p>Cats — so soft, so elegant, so quiet… yet, something about them makes my heart race. I find them adorable from afar — the way they curl up in sunlit corners, their curious eyes, and those tiny meows. But when they get too close, I freeze. Maybe it's their unpredictability. Maybe it's the mystery in their stare. But one thing’s for sure: I admire them. They are little queens of calm and chaos, wrapped in fur. Cute, scary, magical — all at once.</p>
    </div>      

    <div class="blog-card" id="sunset">
      <h2>🌇 Golden Hues of Goodbye</h2>
      <p>Sunsets are proof that endings can be beautiful too. I love watching the sky change colors — each one so unique. The golden light, the warmth, and the peaceful silence make me feel grounded. I try to capture that moment often, either in my mobile camera or in my heart.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="blog-card" id="sky">
      <h2>☁️ Sky — Canvas of My Calm</h2>
      <p>The sky changes like my moods — sometimes calm and clear, sometimes stormy and dramatic. I find inspiration in clouds, stars, and endless blues. It reminds me to dream big and to always look up — because there’s beauty in every direction if we choose to see it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="blog-card" id="introvert">
      <h2>🌿 Embracing the Quiet Within</h2>
      <p>It's okay to be quiet — to observe, to feel deeply, and to stay wrapped in your own calm. Being introverted is a strength, not a flaw. I’m not someone who likes the limelight; I’m most comfortable with my people. With them, I’m talkative and fun. To some, I may seem silent or boring, to others, playful or even full of attitude. But really, I’m just being myself — different sides for different vibes.</p>
